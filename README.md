  <p>Currently, I am working on several projects. These are:</p>
  <a>‚Ä¢ <b>game.exe</b> - A game I'm working on which uses no external libraries or frameworks, other than ones written by me<br></a>
  <a>‚Ä¢ <b>bambooOS</b> - An operating system written in Assembly + C++<br></a>
  <a>‚Ä¢ <b>NEPL</b> - An Interpreted language written in Java, and soon to be written in C/C++<br><br></a>
  
  <p>I'm really interested in open source code, and soon I'll release some of the libraries which I have written, such as the game engine which I'm using to make game.exe.</p>
