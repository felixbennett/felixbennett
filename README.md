    <h3> Tools and Skills! üî® <h3> 
      
    <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>
      <h4> This is my favourite IDE as it has lots of room for extension and documentation and is extremely stable </h4>
    <a href="https://replit.com/">Replit</a>
      <h4> This is a great tool. I use it to host some websites and projects, and it is good for collaboration. </h4>
    <a href="https://www.javascript.com/">JavaScript</a>
      <h4> This is one of my favourite backend programming languages. This usually goes in hand with HTML and CSS and it runs the web. </h4>
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/htmlcss">HTML and CSS</a>
       <h4> This is the code i am best at. It is extremely easy, little learning curve and i would advice that people start with this for front end. </h4>
    <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>
       <h4> I know some Python. Honestly i have switched over to JavaScript for my function based back end code, but this is a good starting point. </h4>
     <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html?promoid=RBS7NL7F&mv=other">Photoshop</a>
     <h4> A great tool for front end development. This is great for adding advanced gradients to web pages and stuff you cannot do with CSS. I like this tool. </h4>
      <a href="https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/premiere.html?mv=search&mv=search&sdid=LQLZT7BT&ef_id=CjwKCAjw8KmLBhB8EiwAQbqNoPOodaUYvMLgS31GKNx4b0dgEESRfnAY8RhdAotNLW_NBQ3dHEPUtBoCdNkQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!340721779838!e!!g!!premiere%20pro!1422700289!54632152023&gclid=CjwKCAjw8KmLBhB8EiwAQbqNoPOodaUYvMLgS31GKNx4b0dgEESRfnAY8RhdAotNLW_NBQ3dHEPUtBoCdNkQAvD_BwE">Premiere Pro</a>  
      <h4> This is a great tool for front end. It is good for marketing the project and adding effects to a webpage, app and more. </h4>
   
      <h5> and i am constantly learning... so expect more soon! <h5>
